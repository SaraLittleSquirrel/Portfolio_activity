# Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate Course Activities

Welcome to my Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate course activity repository. This repository is organized by chapters, with dedicated sections for portfolio activities. The "practice activities" folder is not included, and this repository is intended for reference purposes, not for collaboration or use by others.

## Purpose
This repository serves the purpose of documenting my progress and solutions for portfolio activities within the Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate course. It is organized by chapters for easy reference.

## Directory Structure
The repository follows a directory structure that separates portfolio activities by chapters:

- **Chapter 01**
  - **Portfolio Activities:** This section includes my solutions and documentation for portfolio assignments in Chapter 01.

(Continue this structure for each chapter in the course.)
